# **HELLO WORLD**

My name is Blanca, I´m a 32 years young woman from Valladolid (Spain).
I have always had a curious nature and I am always looking for new challenges to learn new skills.
I started my adventure in web developing at the *ADALAB WEB DEVELOPING BOOTCAMP* an online and intensive course that lasted 3 months where I learnt technologies such as: 

 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - JavaScript
 - React JS
 - Sass
 - Node JS
 - SQL
 - GIT-GITHUB
 - Visual Studio

## What am I up to now?
I am working on my portfolio and also in learning new technologies and improving my coding logic on websites like codewars, hackerrank and frontendmentor.
